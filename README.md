# GuessingGame
My Guessing Game Project, created with the help of Twitter Bootstrap

Features:
-Generates a number from 1-100

-Verifies that input is a number from 1-100

-Keeps track of users previous guesses

-Tells user if they're getting warmer or colder, based on if the
most recent guess is closer than the guess before that

-Tells the user whether they need to guess higher or lower

-If the user is within 5 of the answer, it tells them they're super hot

-Tells user if they repeated a guess, but still counts it

-If the user can't guess within 5 guesses, the game is over and they
need to click the Play Again button

-Show Hint button shows the answer

-If the user guesses the answer, the screen flashes

-Play Again refreshes the page
